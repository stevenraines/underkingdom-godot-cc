# Feature - Implement full data-based calendar
**Goal**: The player will progress through a calendar with years, seasons, months, weeks, days, and times of day.

---

If a player's path is blocked by an NPC who is not hostile to the character within their shop, trying to move into their space should trigger their primary interaction. For instance, for NPCs who sell things, this should bring up the trade menu. 

Outside of the shop it should say "Your path is blocked by {npc name}"
