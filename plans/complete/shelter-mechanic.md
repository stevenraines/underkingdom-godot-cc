# Feature: Shelter Mechanic
**Goal**: Allow the player to camp and sleep to recover health.

---

Players currently can build a campfire and a shelter. Let's expand this. If the player enters their shelter, every X turns they rest (configured in data) restores 1 HP.

If the player creates a camp fire, enemies outside the range of the campfire will not enter it. 

Players cannot Craft while enemies are nearby.
