# Feature ideas to flesh out with Claude

## v1.0 Updates 
---
- [x] Add game animals (rabbits, deer, etc.) appropriate to each biome.
- [X] Improve performance of overworld lighting
- [X] Detect & Disarm Traps (N / SHIFT-N)
- [X] Include skill and attack check values (roll, ability modifier, skill bonus, other bonuses)  in the log so players can see their roll
- [X] Fix chests not giving treasure
- [X] Add a mining mechanic. In dungeons, a vein of ore should sometimes run through the dungeon so that it intersects a corridor or room. Players should be able to mine out that vein to collect ore. Base this on the mining mechanic for other roguelikes.
- [X] fix bug - Saltmere is not always placed next to the ocean, as inland water is considered ocean instead of fresh water.
