# Feature - Prevent unneccessary item use
**Goal**: Players should not be able to use resources that restore vital stats if the stats are already at the max value.

---

A player can currently use a ration to restore the hunger value. The ration is consumed and the hunger value increases. However, the player can choose to use the ration even if their hunger value is already at the max.

Change the system so that a player cannot consume and item  that restores a stat if the stat is already at it's maximum. For "food" items, send a message that says "You are not hungry" and for drink items say "You are not thirsty."
