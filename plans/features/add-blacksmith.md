# Feature: Add Blacksmith

**Goal**: Add a blacksmith who makes armour and weapons and can train the player in crafting

---

The starter town should have a blacksmith shop with an NPC blacksmith. The character should trade items that are armor or weapons. The npc can also train the player to craft armor and weapons. Any receipe with metal requires a forge and an anvil. Make those as structures like the campfire - as things the player may be near for the puposes of crafting.
