# Feature: Add Farm

**Goal**: Generate a new farm outside of the starter town

---

Now that the farming mechanic is implemented, lets create a farm near the Starter town. A road should lead from the town to the farm. The farm should be a new building. Near the buildings should be an area 4X5 of wheat, and an area 2x5 of carrots. These should be fully grown and harvestable.

The farmer should trade food goods (eggs, jar of milk, etc), seeds for farming, and harvesting implements (sickle, scythe, hoe)
