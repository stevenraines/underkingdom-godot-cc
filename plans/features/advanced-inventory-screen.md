# Feature: Advanced inventory screen

**Goal**: Provide a better inventory experience for players as their inventory grows.

---

As a player's inventory grows, it becomes harder to manage. Design an improved UI around these concepts

1. Grouping / filtering of items by type - provide UI that allows a player to see items in groups (weapons, tools, consumables) or filter by these options.
2. Order of items - items should be listed from least expensive to most expensive (within whatever group or filter is shown)
3. Still allow going through all items

When shopping, the same features should be available in the shop keepers inventory screen for both player and shopkeeper.
