# Feature - Closable Doors
**Goal**: Doors should be able to be opened and closed.

---

When the shop was added, the concept of a door was created.
The player, NPCs, and some enemies should be able to open or close doors.

* Open doors should be represented by the + symbol
* Closed doors should be represented by the ' symbol.
* Closed doors block movement
* A NPC / creature with intelligence of 5+ can open doors
* An NPC / creature with intelligence of 8+ will close doors if avoiding a hostile creature. 
* A door can't be closed if something is occupying that space.
* Closed doors block the player from seeing what is on the other side.
