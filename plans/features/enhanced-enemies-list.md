# Feature - Extend the enemies list & the places they appear.
**Goal**: Create a robust list of enemies and where they should appear.

---
Create enemy entries for the creatures found at:
https://donjon.bin.sh/5e/monsters/

For each dungeon, modify the enemies that appear. Lower levels in the dungeons should have lower CR levels. As the player delves deeper more challenging enemies should appear. Enemies should be appropriate to the type of dungeon. Creatures that are wilderness (wolves, etc) should only appear outdoors, with lower challenge ratings closer to civilization.

Also update any existing enemies with appropriate CR levels.

Ask any clarifying questions you have before impementing this feature.

Begin by extending the enemies based on monsters from AD&D.
