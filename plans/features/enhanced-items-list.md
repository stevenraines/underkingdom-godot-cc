# Feature - Extend the items list 
**Goal**: Create a robust list of items available in the game world 

---

Extend the list of items based on the item tables from AD&D. All new items should be based on the item templates, with appropriate variants.

Properly categorize items into the folder structure and add all properties to the json that are needed to support all the existing system, including but not limited to:

Wearable items impact the player's warmth / coolness withiin the SurvivialSystem temperature (may need update to Survivial System)

Create recipes for craftable items. If an item requires an item to craft that does not exist, create the item needed.

Make sure any items that emit light (like lanterns) work the same way that torches do and can be used in place of them.

Update the loot tables accordingly for new items.
