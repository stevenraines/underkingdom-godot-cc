# Feature - Fast Travel
**Goal**: Player should be able to FAST TRAVEL to any locations they area aware of. 

---

Each dungeon and town should have an indicator for whether the player has visited it or not. If so, that location should appear on a fast travel screen and the player should be able to select it and automatically be teleported to a walkable tile near the entrace of the dungeon or within the town bounds.

At the start of the game, all towns should have a default state of visited and all dungeons should not. A dungeon should be marked visited once the player first enters the chunk that dungeon is located in.

Use the same interface look and feel as the character screen
