# Feature - Fishing mechanic
**Goal**: Implement a system for fishing.

---

When a player is standing next to a body of water with more than 8 contiguous water tiles, they can engage in fishing if they have the right equipment.

A player must have a fishing rod or net. If the player has a rod, they must have bait. Fishing is like harvesting. Each turn the player fishes, there is a percentage chance they will catch something. If the player fishes for more than 10 turns and catches nothing, the player should be presented with the message that fish are not biting today.

When the player successfully catches a fish, it should place fish into the player's inventory. Create a fish as an item template with various variants for the type of fish.
