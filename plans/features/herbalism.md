# Feature: Herbalism
**Goal**: Expand the wild flora the player can find and how it can be used.

---

Players currently can use a "healing herb" to make bandages and potions. Lets add a variety of herbs and flowers so the player can collect them. Plants should grow in specific biomes appropriate to thme (mandrakes and orchids in marsh for instance.) Use the variant features creating these from a base herb, base flower, and base mushroom.

The player should be able to collect these and they should respawn after a certain number of turns.

Then modify the healing_herb using the bandage and healing potion to use a mixture of 3 herbs. Which herbs they are should be determined randomly (based on the seed) for each game so the player doesn't know what they will be from one seed to the next. 

In the future, we will create additional receipes for these herbs, flowers, and mushrooms.
