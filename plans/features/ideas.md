# Feature ideas to flesh out with Claude

- [ ] Test mode (CMD) where the player can perform actions to help debug the system (give players items, increase level, gold, spawn items, hazards, features, creatures, etc)
- [ ] Weapon damage types & resistances - reference https://scrollforinitiative.com/2023/08/19/a-complete-guide-to-the-13-damage-types-in-dd-part-one/ for the types to implement. Creatures should be able to have vulnerabilty, resistance, or immunity to these just like the implementation for various types of magic. Magic items always deal magic damage as their type. for examples, skeletons should have resistance to piercing weapons but vulnerability to bludgeoning weapons. Fire based creatures should be immune to fire attacks, etc.
- [x] Add game animals (rabbits, deer, etc.) appropriate to each biome.
- [X] Improve performance of overworld lighting
- [X] Detect & Disarm Traps (Hazards) Actions
- [X] Include skill and attack check values (roll, ability modifier, skill bonus, other bonuses)  in the log so players can see their roll
- [X] Fix chests not giving treasure
- [/] Add a mining mechanic. In dungeons, a vein of ore should sometimes run through the dungeon so that it intersects a corridor or room. Players should be able to mine out that vein to collect ore. Base this on the mining mechanic for other roguelikes.
- [ ] Modify mine generation so that in addition to the fixed mine design, sometimes mines run into a cave system.
- [ ] Modify all dungeon generators so they have an layout for when they are above ground. For instance, a fort or tower should have structure above ground. The barrow should have a crypt and be surrounded by tombstones, etc.

- [ ] Add secret doors to dungeons using traditional roguelike mechanics. Players should be able to detect secret doors like the detect traps.
