# Feature: Improve data driveness.

**Goal**: The system should be as data driven as possible.

Address the issues below.

looking in player.gd, I see there are tile types with icons. Can these use icons assigned in data instead of being hard coded?

The shop's trade inventory is also in the npc.gd. These should come from each NPC's data definition.
