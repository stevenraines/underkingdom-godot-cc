# Feature: Name Generation

**Goal**: Have the system be able to dynamically generate fantasy names for NPCs, towns, enemies, books, etc.

---
The system should have a good way to generate names for use in the seeded worlds. Some examples of things we'd like to be able to name:

NPCs
Humanoid Enemies
Books
Towns
Forts & Towers
Ships

The naming conventions should draw from western european and nordic styles. Humanoid creatures should have similar naming conventions within a race (dwarves, goblins, elves)

Research the best way to techniques these names locally (no LLM) and create a plan to build the name generator and incorporate it into the system.
