# Feature - Notify on blocking tile
**Goal**: If a player can't move into a tile, explain why.

---

When a player ties to move into a tile but is blocked, there is no message stating why. In the circumstance where the player is not interacting, attacking, etc and is just trying to walk through a tile, post a message that says something like "you path is blocked by {blocking tile name}"

For example:
Your path is blocked by a tree.
Your path is blocked by a rock.
Your path is blocked by a shrine.
