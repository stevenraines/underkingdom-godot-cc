# Feature: NPC Extend NPC Services

**Goal**: Give some NPCs the ability to render services to the player, not just teach recepies

---
Currently, when the player interacts with an NPC, the npc may have more than one type of interaction. Currently, these are "Trade" and "Learn". We want the NPC to offer multiple kinds of services.

The options should be:
1. Trade (the current trade screen)
2. Learn - player can learn different kinds of things:
    1. Receipes (the current Receipes)
    2. Spells (spell casters can teach spells to be inscribed in a spellbook)
    3. Capabilities (spell casters can teach how to cast spells)
3. Train - Teach the player, advancing their skills.
