# Feature: Rename world seed input on new game to be Character Name

**Goal**: Change the dialog for creating a new name to label the world seed as character name

---
Each character should get a unique experience, so we should generate the seed from the characters name. 

To do this, change the lable for the seed input on the new game screen to read "Character Name". Save this name to the character and show it on the Character Sheet and in the death screen. When creating the game seed, derive it from this name the same way it is now.
