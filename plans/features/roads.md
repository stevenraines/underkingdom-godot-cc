**Goal**: The island should have roads connecting certain structures.

Since there are towns, they should be connected by roads made of various materials. Close to man made structures, these should be cobblestone, brick, etc. A little further they should be gravel. In remote areas they should be dirt paths.

The generator that creates towns should create roads after the towns are made. Wihtin the towns, create roads that connect buildings. If the town design is town square, then the town square should also be all made of road material.

Towns should have a flag indicating if they are connected by roads. If so, they should be connected to the nearest two towns.
