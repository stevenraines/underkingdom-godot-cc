## Version 1.4 Updates

- [ ] Scaled Loot Drops
    Loot drops shoulds be based on the scale of the creature. Review https://dungeonmastertools.github.io/treasure.html and the related pages to improve how loot tables work to make them more realistic. Consider having separate loot tables by type/CR instead of creature, and have each creature have a list of loot_tables instead of one.
