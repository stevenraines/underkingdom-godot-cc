## Version 1.6 Updates 
---

- [x] "Fresh Water" not recognized when crafting because it is contained in a container(#105)
    Fixed: Added `provides_ingredient` property to items. Full Waterskin now provides fresh_water for crafting and transforms to Empty Waterskin when used.
- [ ] Healing Salve receipe can't be created (#101)
    This receipe does not have ingredients so it can't be made.
- [ ] "blocked by stone floor" bug (#103)
    A player can receive an error message that they are blocked by a stone floor.  this may be caused by the spawn location of a zombie that was defeated in combat, but not sure
- [ ] Some overworld drops cannot be picked up (#102)
    After defeating opponents in combat, player was unable to pick up loot drops
