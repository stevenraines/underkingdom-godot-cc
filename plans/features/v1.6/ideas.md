## Version 1.6 Updates

- [ ] Can't craft receipes that require consumable item "fresh water" (#105)
    not available from NPC sell lists, not provided by full waterskin, no crafting recipe

    Could full waterskin provide fresh water and leave behind empty waterskin like using waterskin to increase thirst from inventory

    Could "fresh water" be harvested from well for recipe use in distinct container, for example a bucket or flask?

    Could a built structure- barrel (or cistern or cauldron) be used for "fresh water" ingredient?

    Could proximity to a well, similar to proximity to campfire be used to provide "fresh water" ingredient?
- [ ] "blocked by stone floor" bug (#103)
    A player can receive an error message that they are blocked by a stone floor.  this may be caused by the spawn location of a zombie that was defeated in combat, but not sure
- [ ] Some overworld drops cannot be picked up (#102)
    After defeating opponents in combat, player was unable to pick up loot drops
- [ ] Healing Salve receipe can't be created (#101)
